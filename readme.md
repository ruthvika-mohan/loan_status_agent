Hi [Name],

I'm Ruthvika, an Applied AI Scientist at Tesco with experience building 
production LLM systems. I'm very interested in the Solution Architect role 
at smallest.ai.

I recently built a voice agent for loan inquiries that demonstrates the 
exact skills you're looking for:
🎯 Demo: [notion.link]
📂 GitHub: [github.link]

Key highlights:
- Conversational flow design
- LLM + state machine architecture
- Multi-channel deployment (voice/text/phone)
- Production-ready patterns

Would love to discuss how my experience with enterprise AI systems aligns 
with smallest.ai's vision.

Best,
Ruthvika
